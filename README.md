# Timer

<p>My first project made in React for one year ago. Simple timer built with class components. I didn't use Create React App, just linked scripts to body in HTML</p>

<h3>How to open a file? ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€</h3>
<p>- On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.</p>
<p>- An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.</p>
<p>- Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.</p>
<p>- And then "go live" is enough!</p>

<h3>What have I learned?</h3>
<p>:pushpin: Differance between class and functional components</p>
<p>:pushpin: How to use state in class components and the role of <b>this</b></p>
